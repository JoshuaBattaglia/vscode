# Project: MiliLife

##### BETA, V3

## Everything You need to know

Project: MiliLife is a Simple program that tells you how many seconds, minutes, hours and days old you are! Please Do not edit ANYTHING else then the MainProgram folder's scripts and the Extra/binx folder's scripts. The Extra/binx folder has a simple script you can edit or use however you'd like. You also can add anything you want to the scripts or folders, and you can also make new folders if you wish. You can see more info in the "ReadBeforeModifying" File.


## Modifying

The only thing I have to note is to not delete the MainProgram, the .vscode, and the ReadBeforeModifying, (For safety reasons!)
